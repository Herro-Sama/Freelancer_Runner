Oh bother!
I need a cuppa tea!
Sorry!
Spiffing!
God save the Queen!
Looks like there's a heatwave coming in.
I should have brought more sun cream.
Is it me or is it getting hot around here?
Need to find some shade!
It's so hot that I just saw a chicken lay a fried egg.
It's so hot that I burned my house down just to cool it off!
I could really use an ice cream!
If only there was a bottle of water around here.
Maybe running in a heatwave isnt a good idea.
Feelin' hot hot hot.
